# TODO
- Card encoding
- Card-tet encoding
- Board encoding
- Time state encoding
- Row clearing encoding

- given some amount of card tets, can you get to the point where 
- you were able to place all the card tets down 

- LTL
- Bin packing problem (knapsack problem?)

- what is a valid move (encoding)

- Given n number of card tets, can we make a row/col go to 21?
